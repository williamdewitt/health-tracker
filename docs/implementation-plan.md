# Detailed Implementation Plan for Health Tracker Application

This document outlines a detailed implementation plan for the Health Tracker application following the iDesign layered architecture: Models, Data Access, Engines, and Managers.

---

## 1. Models Layer (Data Structures)

### Components:
- **User**
  - Properties: Id, Name, Email, BloodType, Preferences, AuthenticationInfo (excluding password due to Clerk integration)
- **NutritionEntry**
  - Properties: Id, UserId, Date, MealType (enum), List of FoodItems, TotalCalories, Macronutrients
- **FoodItem**
  - Properties: Id, Name, Calories, Protein, Carbs, Fat, ServingSize
- **ExerciseEntry**
  - Properties: Id, UserId, Date, ExerciseType (enum), Duration, CaloriesBurned
- **HealthMetricEntry**
  - Properties: Id, UserId, Date, MetricType (enum), Value
- **FoodSuggestion**
  - Properties: Id, UserId, SuggestedFoods, AvoidedFoods, BasedOnBloodType
- **Enumerations**
  - MealType, ExerciseType, HealthMetricType, BloodType, etc.

### Implementation Notes:
- Use C# classes with data annotations for validation.
- Define enums for fixed categories.
- Ensure DTOs are designed for API communication.

---

## 2. Data Access Layer (Infrastructure)

### Components:
- **Repositories**
  - UserRepository: CRUD and queries for User entities.
  - NutritionRepository: Manage NutritionEntry and FoodItem persistence.
  - ExerciseRepository: Manage ExerciseEntry data.
  - HealthMetricRepository: Manage HealthMetricEntry data.
  - FoodSuggestionRepository: Manage FoodSuggestion data.
- **Database Context**
  - Centralized DbContext for Entity Framework Core or equivalent ORM.
- **External Integrations**
  - Interfaces and adapters for external APIs (e.g., food databases).

### Implementation Notes:
- Use repository pattern with dependency injection.
- Implement async methods for database operations.
- Ensure proper indexing and relationships for efficient queries.

---

## 3. Engines Layer (Business Logic)

### Components:
- **UserEngine**
  - User management, profile updates, authentication integration.
- **NutritionEngine**
  - Create, update, validate nutrition entries.
  - Calculate total calories and macronutrients.
- **ExerciseEngine**
  - Manage exercise logging and validation.
- **HealthMetricEngine**
  - Process health metrics, validation, trend analysis.
- **FoodSuggestionEngine**
  - Generate personalized food suggestions based on user data and blood type diet rules.
- **AuthenticationEngine**
  - Manage authentication workflows, token handling, security policies.
- **Validation and Policy Services**
  - Shared services for input validation and business rules.

### Implementation Notes:
- Encapsulate all business rules and logic here.
- Engines depend only on Data Access and Models.
- Write unit tests for all business logic.

---

## 4. Managers Layer (Orchestration)

### Components:
- **API Controllers**
  - UserController: Registration, profile, authentication endpoints.
  - NutritionController: CRUD for nutrition entries and food items.
  - ExerciseController: Exercise logging endpoints.
  - HealthMetricController: Health metric management endpoints.
  - FoodSuggestionController: Retrieve personalized suggestions.
- **Frontend (Blazor) Components**
  - Modular UI components for data entry, visualization, reporting.
  - Authentication UI components integrated with backend.
- **API Service Modules**
  - Client-side services to communicate with backend APIs.
- **Authentication Components**
  - Login, logout, session management UI and logic.

### Implementation Notes:
- Controllers orchestrate use cases by calling Engines.
- Blazor components should be reusable and follow best practices.
- Implement responsive design and accessibility.
- Use RESTful API design principles.

---

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

- **Security**
  - Implement authentication and authorization at Managers layer.
  - Secure data handling and privacy compliance.
- **Testing**
  - Unit tests for Engines and Data Access.
  - Integration tests for API controllers.
  - End-to-end tests for UI workflows.
- **Documentation**
  - Maintain up-to-date code comments and memory bank documentation.
- **CI/CD**
  - Automate builds, tests, and deployments using GitHub Actions or equivalent.

This plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for building the Health Tracker application with clear separation of concerns and adherence to iDesign principles. Next steps include scaffolding the project structure and implementing foundational models and repositories.
