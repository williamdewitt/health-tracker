# Project Brief

The Health Tracker project is a full-stack application designed to help users monitor and manage their health-related data, including nutrition, exercise, and personal health metrics. The system consists of a backend API and a frontend user interface. The backend is built with .NET and provides RESTful endpoints for data management and authentication. The frontend is a React-based web application that interacts with the backend API to provide a seamless user experience.

The primary goals of the project are:
- To provide users with an intuitive interface to log and track their health data.
- To ensure secure user authentication and data privacy.
- To support extensibility for future health tracking features.
- To maintain a clean, maintainable, and well-documented codebase.

The project is structured into two main parts:
- Backend API: Located in the `backend/HealthTrackerApi` directory.
- Frontend Application: Located in the `frontend/` directory.

This project uses modern web technologies and follows best practices for security, performance, and user experience.
