# Project Brief

The Health Tracker project has been restarted with a new simplified structure. All source code will now reside in a single `src/` folder, and all testing code will be placed in a separate `test/` folder at the root level.

The previous backend and frontend separation has been removed to streamline development and maintenance. The project currently contains only minimal files and the memory bank documentation.

The primary goals of the restarted project are:
- To establish a clean and minimal starting point for development.
- To organize source and test code clearly in dedicated folders.
- To maintain a well-documented memory bank to guide future development.
- To support extensibility and maintainability as the project evolves.
- To continue following the iDesign architectural principles for maintainability and scalability.

This project will continue to use modern web technologies and best practices for security, performance, and user experience, but the architecture and implementation will be revisited as development progresses.
