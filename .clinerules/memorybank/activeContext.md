# Active Context

This document captures the current focus and recent changes in the Health Tracker project.

## Current Work Focus
- Developing and maintaining the full-stack Health Tracker application.
- Backend API development using .NET, focusing on secure authentication and data management.
- Frontend Blazor application development for intuitive user interfaces to log and track health data.
- Implementing personalized food suggestions and blood type diet assistance features.

## Recent Changes
- Initial project setup with backend and frontend directories.
- Established core project goals and structure in project brief and product context.
- Updated memory bank to reflect .docs design documentation, iDesign architecture, and preferred repo structure.
- Restarted project with simplified structure: all source code in `src/` and tests in `test/` folders.
- Removed previous backend and frontend separation and implementation.
- Updated product context, system patterns, tech context, and progress documents to reflect Blazor frontend.
- Drafted foundational data structures in docs/data-structures.md.
- Updated data structures to remove password field due to Clerk integration.
- Added features for food suggestions and blood type diet assistance in data structures.

## Next Steps
- Continue implementing features for nutrition, exercise, and health metrics tracking.
- Enhance user authentication and data privacy mechanisms.
- Improve user experience with responsive design and clear visualizations.
- Ensure ongoing alignment with documented architecture, repo structure, and testing strategy.
- Develop new architecture and implementation based on simplified project structure.
- Continue following iDesign architectural principles for maintainability and scalability.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Prioritize security and privacy in all data handling.
- Ensure extensibility for future health tracking features.
- Maintain clean, maintainable, and well-documented codebase.

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Use RESTful API design for backend endpoints.
- Blazor for frontend UI with modular components.
- Follow best practices for security, performance, and user experience.

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Integration of backend and frontend is critical for seamless user experience.
- Clear documentation and structured codebase facilitate ongoing development and maintenance.
- External user management via Clerk simplifies authentication and security.
- Personalized nutrition guidance enhances user engagement and health outcomes.
- Planning to integrate Three.js to add interactive and visually engaging 3D elements to the Blazor frontend UI, enhancing user experience and interface appeal.
