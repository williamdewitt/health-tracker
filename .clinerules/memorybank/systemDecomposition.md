# System Decomposition for Health Tracker

This document defines the system decomposition for the Health Tracker project based on the product context and iDesign architectural principles.

## 1. Layers of the System (iDesign 3-Layer Hierarchical Structure)

- **Managers Layer (Orchestration Layer):**
  - Entry points for the system such as API controllers and UI components.
  - Orchestrates use cases and business workflows.
  - Coordinates interactions between Engines and Data Access layers.

- **Engines Layer (Business Logic Layer):**
  - Implements core business rules, domain logic, and complex operations.
  - Processes data and enforces validation and policies.
  - Independent of UI and infrastructure concerns.

- **Data Access Layer (Infrastructure Layer):**
  - Handles all I/O operations including database access and external service integrations.
  - Implements repositories and data mappers.
  - Abstracts persistence details from higher layers.

- **Models Layer (Data Structures):**
  - Defines DTOs, entities, value objects, enums, and contracts.
  - Shared across all layers to ensure consistency.

## 2. Component Decomposition

- **Backend:**
  - API Controllers (Managers) exposing RESTful endpoints.
  - Business Services (Engines) encapsulating health tracking logic.
  - Repositories (Data Access) managing data persistence.
  - Data Models representing users, nutrition, exercise, and health metrics.

- **Frontend:**
  - Blazor Components (Managers) for UI rendering and user interaction.
  - State Management and Services (Engines) handling client-side logic and API communication.
  - Data Models shared or mapped from backend models.

## 3. Dependency Rules

- Managers depend on Engines, Data Access, and Models.
- Engines depend on Data Access and Models only.
- Data Access depends on Models only.
- Models are self-contained and independent.

## 4. Cross-Cutting Concerns

- Authentication and Authorization integrated primarily at the Managers layer.
- Logging, error handling, and validation implemented across layers with clear separation.
- Configuration and environment management centralized.

## Summary

This decomposition ensures maintainability, testability, and scalability while aligning with the product goals of a secure, extensible, and user-friendly health tracking system.
