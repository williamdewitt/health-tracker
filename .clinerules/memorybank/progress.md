- Implement full CRUD operations for nutrition, exercise, and health metrics.
- Develop responsive and intuitive frontend UI for logging and tracking data.
- Integrate backend API with frontend components for seamless data flow.
- Add data visualization and reporting features.
- Enhance security and privacy measures.
- Write comprehensive tests for backend and frontend.

## Current Status
- Project initialized with backend and frontend directories.
- Core architecture and design patterns established.
- Initial API endpoints and frontend components created.
- Memory bank updated to reflect .docs design documentation, iDesign architecture, and preferred repo structure.

## Known Issues

- Some API endpoints lack full implementation.
- Frontend UI needs refinement and additional features.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Adopted RESTful API design for scalability.
- Chose React with TypeScript for frontend for type safety and maintainability.
