# Progress

This document tracks the current status, accomplishments, and remaining work for the Health Tracker project.

## What Works
- Basic backend API setup with .NET, including initial controllers and models.
- Frontend Blazor application scaffolded with core components.
- User authentication flow started in backend and frontend.
- Basic data models for nutrition and health metrics defined.

## What's Left to Build
- Complete user authentication and authorization features.
- Implement full CRUD operations for nutrition, exercise, and health metrics.
- Develop responsive and intuitive frontend UI for logging and tracking data.
- Integrate backend API with frontend components for seamless data flow.
- Add data visualization and reporting features.
- Enhance security and privacy measures.
- Write comprehensive tests for backend and frontend.

## Additional Recommendations for Consideration
- Add validation rules and constraints for key data fields (e.g., email format, positive quantities).
- Define clear relationships and indexing strategies for efficient querying of user-linked entries.
- Expand enumerations to cover more exercise and health metric types as the product evolves.
- Support localization and unit conversions for diverse user bases.
- Ensure strict adherence to iDesign architectural principles in backend implementation.
- Implement comprehensive authentication and authorization mechanisms leveraging extended User data.
- Design RESTful API endpoints with full CRUD support, input validation, error handling, and logging.
- Develop modular Blazor frontend components aligned with core data structures.
- Integrate personalized food suggestions and blood type diet assistance with clear UI flows.
- Prioritize responsive design and accessibility in the frontend.
- Expand unit and integration tests to cover new features and validations.
- Maintain up-to-date documentation in memory bank and code comments.
- Explore integration with external health APIs or devices for richer data.
- Add analytics and visualization components for user insights.
- Plan for scalability and performance optimization as user data grows.
## Current Status
- Project initialized with backend and frontend directories.
- Core architecture and design patterns established.
- Initial API endpoints and frontend components created.
- Memory bank updated to reflect .docs design documentation, iDesign architecture, and preferred repo structure.
- Project restarted with simplified structure: all source code in `src/` and tests in `test/` folders.
- Removed previous backend and frontend separation and implementation.

## Known Issues
- Authentication flow incomplete.
- Some API endpoints lack full implementation.
- Frontend UI needs refinement and additional features.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Adopted RESTful API design for scalability.
- Chose React with TypeScript for frontend for type safety and maintainability.
- Prioritized security and privacy from the start.
- Decided on modular component architecture for frontend.
